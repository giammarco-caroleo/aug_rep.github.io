## Gaussian Process based representation 

In this section, we will discuss the Gaussian Process (GP) based representation of the data. 
As a matter of fact, GP-based representation are widely used and could serve as a way of combining mechanical and visual properties. For a formal introduction to GP, we refer the reader to [1].
